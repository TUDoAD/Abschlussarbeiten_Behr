NewReaction01 - NewReaction04 are the same Datasheets, but they are used to simulate
the System on different ways.

NewReaction01 -> Just Reactor with a wide range in the parameter dice
NewReaction02 -> Just Reactor with a small range in the parameter dice
NewReaction03 -> Reactor and Downstream with a wide range in the parameter dice
NewReaction04 -> Reactor and Downstream with a small range in the parameter dice
