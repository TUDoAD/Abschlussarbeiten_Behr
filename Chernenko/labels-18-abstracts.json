hydroformylation and carbon monoxide hydrogenation (leading to methanol and C2-oxygenates) over Rh\/SiO2 catalysts share several important common mechanistic features, namely, CO insertion and metal-carbon (acyl or alkyl) bond hydrogenation. However, these processes are differentiated in that the CO hydrogenation also requires an initial CO dissociation before catalysis can proceed. In this study, the catalytic response to changes in particle size and to the addition of metal additives was studied to elucidate the differences in the two processes. In the hydroformylation process, both hydroformylation and hydrogenation of ethylene occurred concurrently. The desirable hydroformylation was enhanced over fine Rh particles with maximum activity observed at a particle diameter of 3.5 nm and hydrogenation was favored over large particles. CO hydrogenation was favored by larger particles. These results suggest that hydroformylation occurs at the edge and corner Rh sites, but that the key step in CO hydrogenation is different from that in hydroformylation and occurs on the surface. The addition of group II-VIII metal oxides, such as MoO3, Sc2O3, TiO2, V2O5, and Mn2O3, which are expected to enhance CO dissociation, leads to increased rates in CO hydrogenation, but only served to slow the hydroformylation process slightly without any effect on the selectivity. Similar comparisons using basic metals, such as the alkali and alkaline earths, which should enhance selectivity for insertion of CO over hydrogenation, increased the selectivity for the hydroformylation over hydrogenation as expected, although catalytic activity was reduced. Similarly, the selectivity toward organic oxygenates (a reflection of the degree of CO insertion) in CO hydrogenation was also increased."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-20T15:13:54.585120Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T08:24:20.144266Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":7,"annotations":[{"id":39,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":10,"end":26,"text":"hydroformylation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"VgijGpEbhJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":365,"end":378,"text":"5%Rh on Al2O3","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"en73z-jl-6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":380,"end":393,"text":"1%Co on Al2O3","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"2FrDxlqq4a","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":398,"end":420,"text":"0.5%Co-0.5%Rh on Al2O3","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"vv2bPbzABW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":454,"end":460,"text":"ethane","labels":["Product"]},"id":"Ta_8dcTQ9Z","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":462,"end":470,"text":"propanal","labels":["Product"]},"id":"6x0H5BXOA2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":475,"end":483,"text":"propanol","labels":["Product"]},"id":"tdB4-kbSrG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":489,"end":500,"text":"Rh catalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"wkwyP24X9c","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":520,"end":536,"text":"hydroformylation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"XuNQ3MFPxA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":541,"end":554,"text":"hydrogenation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"fEe9ZHgc77","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":689,"end":702,"text":"hydrogenation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"XCrJ24mIuK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":767,"end":783,"text":"hydroformylation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"ixN2AnzjFK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":792,"end":803,"text":"Rh catalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"NeeslVz5-z","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":812,"end":820,"text":"ethylene","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"AggVxFECMv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":874,"end":876,"text":"CO","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"e0PMSCwZxF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":906,"end":914,"text":"propanal","labels":["Product"]},"id":"EysWIReLEL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":919,"end":927,"text":"propanol","labels":["Product"]},"id":"YliMpp05yz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":213,"end":215,"text":"CO","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"ArvP7tgQFw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":217,"end":222,"text":"C 2H4","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"va53I40sQ8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":227,"end":229,"text":"H2","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"QTcpcZlKaY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-20T22:32:51.899128Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T22:32:51.899128Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-20T22:31:02.762883Z","lead_time":193.47,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9e5cd0c8-6d69-44cb-a232-cc5ca05ee9c0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":7,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"e91da350-labling.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Intrinsic hydroformylation kinetics have been measured in a high-throughput kinetic test setup at temperatures varying from 448 to 498 K, with the total pressure ranging from 1 to 3 MPa.

Three catalysts have been investigated, i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3 and 0.5%Co-0.5%Rh on Al2O3. The main products observed were ethane, propanal and propanol. The Rh catalyst showed the highest hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions in the investigated range of operating conditions. Moreover it was found on all investigated catalysts that the hydrogenation activation energy was about 15-20 kJ mol-1 higher than that for hydroformylation. On the Rh catalyst, higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For this reason, a ﬁtted synthetic strategy is required to develop catalysts based exclusively on Rh2P NPs. To attain this, two synthetic pathways have been devised. In the ﬁrst one, two separate sources of Rh and P were used. In the second one, the Wilkinson complex was employed as a unique source of Rh and P to probe the positive inﬂuence of the well-deﬁned molecular organization on the preparation of dispersed and controlled Rh2P nanoparticles, stabilized by carbon patches formed during the pyrolysis treatment from PPh3. In addition, metallic Rh nanoparticles were also synthesized to be used as reference. All catalysts have been compared by means of: transmission electron microscopy, X- ray diﬀraction, and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy. The application of XAS to the study of Rh2P NPs is unusual and has been essential in the discussion of the results. Starting with a well-deﬁned metal precursor leads to the exclusive formation of Rh2P NPs with excellent catalytic activity for the liquid-phase hydroformylation.

Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) was used as the phosphorus source, and Rh2P supported on silica was prepared by impregnation at a relatively low temperature (550 °C). The turnover frequency (TOF) of styrene hydroformylation was increased to 1496 h−1, which was comparable with some single atom catalysts (SACs). Recycling tests showed a good stability in ﬁve runs. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM, XPS, and other characterizations conﬁrmed the synthesis of the Rh2P structure. The promotion eﬀect of P was bifunctional. On the one hand, the doped P separated the surface Rh atoms, which eliminated the surface hollow sites and prevented excessively strong adsorption of the reactants. On the other hand, electrons transferred from Rh to P, causing the surface Rh atoms to be positively charged, which was favorable for hydroformylation reactions. The geometric eﬀects improved the dispersion and the electronic eﬀects changed the rate-determining step from CO insertion to phenylpropionyl hydrogenation, both leading to a higher hydroformylation activity.

Through cooperativity and synergism, these structures provide a fertile ground for catalyst discovery. Understanding these materials at the atomic scale and how to tune their electronic properties will be key for designing novel catalysts for selective chemistries. Here, we use density functional theory calculations and ﬁrst-principles microkinetic modeling to unveil extensive mechanistic knowledge about the cooperativity of atomically dispersed Rh−ReOx pairs on the γ-alumina support for the hydroformylation of ethylene to propanal. By considering a number of possible pre-catalyst complexes, we conﬁrm that the most stable one is a Rh gem-dicarbonyl species, Rh(CO)2, which, contrary to the homogeneous Wilkinson complex, assumes a 16-electron square-planar geometry by coordinating to two alumina surface oxygen atoms. We ﬁnd the weakening of the Rh−CO coordinative bonds with increasing ReOx loading, conﬁrming an earlier experimental work. We develop mechanisms for two competing reactions, ethylene hydroformylation and hydrogenation, and show that they reproduce experimental observations and trends such as reaction kinetics and, most critically, the increase in hydroformylation selectivity in the presence of ReOx. In these mechanisms, the catalyst is activated by the dissociation of one of the two CO ligands of Rh(CO)2 to allow ethylene and H2 coordination, in that order, and we provide evidence that H2 dissociation on Rh is not oxidative. We determine the hydroformylation rate-limiting step and show that it depends on the local environment of Rh: in the absence of ReOx, the hydroformylation is controlled by the acylation step and requires octahedrally coordinated Rh, namely, re-binding of a CO ligand prior to the acylation; in the presence of ReOx, and owing to the weakening of the Rh−CO bonds, the requisite CO coordination prior to the insertion step becomes rate-controlling. We assert that ReOx steers the reaction toward propanal by impeding a critical rearrangement of the Rh ligands that favors the competing reaction, ethylene hydrogenation.

By doping a second metal of Co, we further improved the activity by 1.7 times, and the highest TOF reached 2563 h−1 on Rh7Co1P4\/SiO2. The addition of Co tuned the electronic environment of surface Rh atoms without changing the crystal structure, and the reaction activity showed a volcano relationship with the Co ratio. DFT calculations showed that Co doping decreased the overall activation energy of surface reactions and destabilized H2 adsorption simultaneously. When x ≤ 2 for Rh8−xCoxP4\/SiO2 catalysts, surface Rh atoms had positive valence and H2 adsorption was exothermic. Therefore, the hydroformylation rate was mainly determined by surface reaction with a ﬁrst order of styrene concentration. When x > 2, however, surface Rh atoms were negatively charged and H2 adsorption became thermodynamically unfavorable. The reaction activity was then determined by H2 adsorption and was independent of styrene concentration. We introduced δE, which was the sum of overall activation energy and H2 coadsorption energy with styrene, to predict activity. Moderate addition of Co decreased the value of δE and promoted the activity, while excessive doping would increase δE.

reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous hydro- formylation of ethylene and propylene were compared at 413−453 K using RhCo3\/MCM-41 as catalysts. The reaction rates of propylene for both hydroformylation and the undesired side reaction of hydrogenation were found to be about one order of magnitude lower than those for ethylene in ﬂow reactor studies. The diﬀerence in the kinetic behavior between ethylene and propylene was investigated by measuring the reaction orders and apparent activation energies, and these macrokinetic observables were analyzed using the degree of rate control (DRC) method. In situ diﬀuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were performed to characterize the surface intermediates formed during the reactions. When the reactant was changed from ethylene to propylene, the IR peak corresponding to adsorbed CO exhibited a signiﬁcant increase, while the IR peaks of the alkyl group decreased in magnitude. Combined with the DRIFTS results, DRC analysis indicates that the ﬁrst step of oleﬁn hydroformylation, the formation of an alkyl group on the catalyst surface, plays a key role in the diﬀerence between ethylene and propylene. This step is kinetically nonrelevant when ethylene is the reactant, but it is one of the rate-controlling steps for propylene. The low concentration of the adsorbed propyl group, which is a common intermediate shared by both hydroformylation and hydrogenation of propylene, decreases the rates of both reaction pathways as compared to ethylene.

Realizing the potential beneﬁts of these catalysts requires active site uniformity and control of their local environment. Here, we propose a catalyst synthesis route for manipulating the local environment of atomically dispersed metal-active sites. This was achieved via the targeted deposition of Rh precursors near atomically dispersed ReOx on γ-Al2O3 using electrostatic interactions. CO probe molecule infrared spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy suggested that Rh could be preferentially located near a single ReOx species or multiple ReOx species by controlling ReOx loading. Rh−ReOx interactions promoted catalytic reactivity and selectivity for ethylene hydroformylation. Kinetic measurements suggested that ReOx species withdrew charge from Rh, weakening Rh−CO interactions, which promoted the concentration of vacant sites under reaction conditions and in turn catalytic reactivity. This work demonstrates a general synthetic approach for creating atomically dispersed heteroatom species consisting of oxophilic and late-transition metals and the importance of regulating the local environment of atomically dispersed metals for maximizing catalytic performance.

for hydroformylation of ethene were prepared by grafting Rh into nests of  SiOZn−OH or  SiOCo−OH species prepared in dealuminated BEA zeolite. X-ray absorption spectra and infrared spectra of adsorbed CO were used to characterize the dispersion of Rh. The Rh dispersion was found to increase markedly with increasing M\/Rh (M = Zn or Co) ratio; further increases in Rh dispersion occurred upon use for ethene hydroformylation catalysis. The turnover frequency for ethene hydroformylation measured for a fixed set of reaction conditions increased with the fraction of atomically dispersed Rh. The ethene hydroformylation activity is 15.5-fold higher for M = Co than for M = Zn, whereas the propanal selectivity is slightly greater for the latter catalyst. The activity of the Co-containing catalyst exceeds that of all previously reported Rh- containing bimetallic catalysts. The rates of ethene hydroformylation and ethene hydrogenation exhibit positive reaction orders in ethene and hydrogen but negative orders in carbon monoxide. In situ IR spectroscopy and the kinetics of the catalytic reactions suggest that ethene hydroformylation is mainly catalyzed by atomically dispersed Rh that is influenced by Rh−M interactions, whereas ethene hydrogenation is mainly catalyzed by Rh nanoclusters. In situ IR spectroscopy also indicates that the ethene hydroformylation is rate limited by formation of propionyl groups and by their hydrogenation, a conclusion supported by the measured H\/D kinetic isotope effect. This study presents a novel method for creating highly active Rh-containing bimetallic sites for ethene hydroformylation and provides new insights into the mechanism and kinetics of this process."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-20T15:25:02.146144Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T08:26:06.777283Z","inner_id":21,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
