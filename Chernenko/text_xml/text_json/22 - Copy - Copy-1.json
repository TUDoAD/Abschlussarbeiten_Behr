        "text":" Regioselectivity is a key point in hydroformylation reactions and its control is still a challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the regioselectivity in heterogeneous hydroformylation can be steered by a surface microenvironment around the Rh clusters, which are surrounded by K species and confined within the silicate-1 zeolites. The K species create a steric hindrance microenvironment on the surface of Rh clusters and tune the electronic property of Rh species, mimicking the Rh-phosphine molecular complex. This microenvironment benefits the linear adsorption of olefins, realizing 83% regioselectivity to linear butyraldehyde with TOF as high as 7328 h-1 in the propylene hydroformylation. Besides, other K species which reduce acidic sites can inhibit the isomerization of long-chain olefins, thus boosting the regioselectivity. The confinement structure can stabilize the Kx^Rh clusters to enhance the catalyst lifetime. This work provides an alternative route for developing selective heterogeneous catalysts through steering the catalyst surface microenvironment."
